// Steamid allowed to manage the match
// ===================================
// Add here the steamid allowed to access the admin menu
// 1 steamID by line !
//
// All players have their own unique "steamID".
// To known what is your steamid :
// - connect you to a server
// - type the following command in your console : status
// (If you don't have the console, follow this tutorial : http://www.counter-script.net/index.php?id=66#faqsource_11 ,)
// This command give you some informations about the server and the player connected.
// In front of your username (in the list) you will find your steamid (e.g. STEAM_0:1:4654565) ;
// - copy-paste ALL your steamID (don't forget the STEAM_ prefix !) in this file.
// 
// As you can see in the example below, that's possible to put a commentary after the steamID.
// (e.g. to specify which owns the steamid.)

// Finally, to don't have to install a complex and huge administration plugin, on your match server,
//		some basics administration options can be enabled : http://code.google.com/p/cssmatch-plugin-en/wiki/Administration .
