// All players have their own unique "steamID".
// To known what is your steamid:
// - connect you to a server
// - type the following command in your console: status
// (If you don't know how to show your console, ask google.)
// This command gives you some information about the server and the player connected.
// In front of your username (in the list) you will find your steamid (e.g. STEAM_0:1:4654565) ;
// - paste your steamID (don't forget the STEAM_ prefix!) in this file.
// 
// As you can see in the example below, it's possible to comment the steamID.
