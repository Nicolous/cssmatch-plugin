// Steamid allowed to manage the match
// ===================================
// Add here the steamid allowed to access the admin menu
// 1 steamID by line !
//
// All players have their own unique "steamID".
// To known what is your steamid:
// - connect you to a server
// - type the following command in your console : status
// (If you don't activated your console, google it)
// This command gives you some information about the server and the player connected.
// In front of your username (in the list) you will find your steamid (e.g. STEAM_0:1:4654565) ;
// - paste your steamID (don't forget the STEAM_ prefix !) in this file.
// 
// As you can see in the example below, it's possible to comment the steamID.

// It's also possible to manage a match by RCON : http://code.google.com/p/cssmatch-plugin-en/wiki/RCON .
// Finally, in order to don't have to install a complex and huge administration plugin on your match server,
//		some basics administration options can be enabled : http://code.google.com/p/cssmatch-plugin-en/wiki/Administration .
